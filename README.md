## UPDATE:
To get the client part of you meteor app use my [meteor-build-client](https://github.com/frozeman/meteor-build-client) NPM package.


Meteor Frontend
===============

This is a demo package to automatically decouple the Meteor frontend part from its backend, for solo distribution.

There is also a blog post about this repo: http://frozeman.de/blog/2013/08/using-meteor-as-frontend-library/


Installation
------------

You need [node](http://nodejs.org/), npm and [grunt-cli](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) installed.

From the root folder of this demo package, run the following command to install the npm packages necessary to run the grunt tasks:

    $ npm install


Usage
-----

To run the meteor server for development go into the `app/` folder and run `$ meteor`.

Just edit your meteor files inside the `app/client/` folder and run `$ grunt` to generate the distribution package.
This will automatically start a server at http://localhost:9000 to test you distribution package.


Deployment
----------

You need to change the `ROOT_URL` variable in the `Gruntfile.js` and set it to the URL of your server, where you want it to deploy.
For deployment just copy the content of the `dist/` folder onto your webserver.

When you use a router you need to configure your webserver in a way that all urls get mapped to the index.html file and let the router do its work (e.g. https://github.com/tmeasday/meteor-router).

To further slim down your meteor build, remove the `standard-app-packages`.

Then add either

    $ meteor add client-app-packages

when using meteor 0.6.3,
or when using the new render engine:

    $ meteor add client-app-packages-spacebars

you then also need to update your meteor app to the new render engine, so that the grunt script will use it.

    $ meteor update --release template-engine-preview-5


Enjoy!
